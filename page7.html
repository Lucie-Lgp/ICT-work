<b><u><head>Data Representation </head></u></b>


<p><font color=pink> Data representation is usefull in everyday life. In class, we learned about lossy and lossless. Lossy is when you compress
files the quality is then reduced to make the file size lower. for example a file of 854 kb can reduce at 75 kb with a lossy compression, and this
quality is only reduced by 50 %. The best part is that sometimes, you wont even see the difference !! 
Like in this picture for example :

<p><font color=orange> Altough sometimes lossy compression can be really usefull, photographs for example need to preserve their optimal quality.
