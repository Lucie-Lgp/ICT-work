<b><u><head>Flowcharts and Algorithms </head></u></b>


<p><font color=green> One of the main thing that we looked at was Flowcharts.Flowcharts are related to algorithm, but first if you wonder what is an algorithm well here is the answer :an algorithm is a sequence of instructions/rules step by step that need to be followed by the computer in order to solve a problem.
A flowchart is a way to show an algorithm as a diagram.
It begins when you see the actual question/problem to solve. At the beginning you will have a box with the word "start" or at the end "end" these boxes are called terminators. In flowcharts there are plenty of symbols. The oval box shows us where to start or where to end.
 The parallelogram box is used to tell us was is the input is or what the output might be.
 The diamond shaped box is called a decision box this box shows the  question/problem is asked.
The lines in a flowchart are called  flow lines,they show the direction the process takes.
Flowcharts should be drawn from the top downwards and left to right. In flow chart there are things called inputs and outputs,an example of an input might be to tell us to add some text. An example of an output might be a buzzer to press. Now you know everything on flowcharts !!
