<p><font color=purple> Flash is an app on windows ten that you can use to create an animation the full name is 'ADOBE fLASH PROFECIONAL CS6'
It is very simple to use. When you click on the app it is imperative that you choose the version 3.1. The you can selct a time and draw then press 
 on another time and draw the next image. It thought this lesson was very fun and interusting.
