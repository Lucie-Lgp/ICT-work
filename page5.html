 Passwords and security

One of the main things to know when you own any kind of electronic device is to learn how to protect yourself. First, choose well your password. A good password should include letters,numbers and characters (e.g: @,&,#). But never use this if you want to be secure:</p>
<p>- Name of pet</p>
<p>- Your own name</p>
<p>- a random word from the dictionary</p>
<p>- date of birth</p>
<p>And other personal things because the first passwords hackers try are mainly personnal things. Keeping your data safe is quiet important as well. Protect yourself by: 
-when installing new apps always look at what the app wants (eg: access to contacts, access to camera ect)
-Never use a personal e-mail for online game except, create a e-mail address that you use only for online games. Even better use a fake e-mail anytime possible like: oufero.uefhgo@crejbf.ojerf. But avoid subscribing to 
onlines games is still the best advice.
- Check regularly your mobile device to check if you have any viruses.
- Always log of from your e-mail/computer/other social medias accounts.

Protecting your data is really hard to do because you can't ensure that you are protected 100%.
