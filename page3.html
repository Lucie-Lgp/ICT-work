<p><font color=gold>We worked on Decomposition as well!</font> </p>
<p><font color=gold>Decomposition is when you break your big problem into smaller problems.</font><p>

<p><font color=gold>For example: My friend invited my for a sleep over.</font> </p>
<p><font color=gold> In order to do this I will have to break it down.</font> </p> 
<p><font color=gold>And I will end with a list of things to solve: Look where the house of my friend is,Get the permission from my parents,know at wich time my parents will pick me up,and what do I need to bring to the sleepover.</font></p>
<p><font color=gold>I will then have to solve all those little problems.</font> </p>
<p><font color=gold>When all of this is solved my big problem is solved,this process is called Decomposition.</font></p>
<p><font color=gold>In class, Our teacher gave us a problem: build a tower with the resources.</font> </p>
<p><font color=gold>We had: staws,sicors,rulers,tape,gluesticks,paper and string.</font> </p>
<p><font color=gold>In my group we did a tall tower with a paper boat in top of it. We used: 4 rulers,tape,5 straws,4 gluesticks,1 piece of paper and tape. </font> </p>
<p><font color=gold>The class had 5 minutes of planning and 15 minutes of building.</font> </p>
